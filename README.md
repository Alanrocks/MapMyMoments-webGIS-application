**Explore the application here**: https://photobucket-a055b.web.app

## Project overview
Map My Memoments is a snapchat-like web-based application that enables its users to share its moment with the world, and it's also **installable** for **PC** and **Android** users. 
Login and signup avaliable with email and password.

The application integrated the use of 
- HTML
- CSS 
- Javascript
- Firebase (authentication & data management)
- Mapbox
- WebGIS
- PWA

The GIS application I have developed is a secure web-based platform for data sharing and mapping. With its user-friendly interface and offline access capability, it provides an excellent experience for users. I have utilized Mapbox GL LS to provide an interactive map that enhances the user experience.

To ensure the security and privacy of users, I have designed and implemented a secure authentication system on Firebase. The system uses encrypted passwords and validation checks to ensure secure data access. I have customized the map style to make data representation visually appealing and easy to understand.

This application is my first web/GIS development project aimed to integrate all the skills I learned in recent studies. I am thrilled to have had the opportunity to develop this application and share it with you. Hope you enjoyed it. If you have any questions or would like to know more about my experience developing this app, please don't hesitate to reach out.
